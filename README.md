2022 NCAA March Madness Simulation 
==========

Written in R and Developed by [Andrew Couch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-couch/)

## Description 

A short simulation was created for an entry to my works' march madness bracket. The simulation uses ELO scores that were created from the most recent basketball season. I decided to simulate the march madness bracket since I do not know anything about college sports and basketball. The simulation uses a Monte Carlo simulation with the ELO scores that update throughout the bracket.

## Code for the simulation
